# Enter Wanted Test

This project is to create a web form that will generate the text to submit to the NCIC to add a warrant.

It is assumed that if incorrect entry occurs, the proper error message will be displayed to assist the user in correcting their mistakes.

Development on the application has been focused only on completing the form and validations, stylistic concerns are not being addressed at this time.

### The requirements are as follows for each field, and the results:

alpha: any alphabetical characters, upper or lower case

numeric: numbers only, 0-9

special: these are any characters other than numbers and letters, including blank spaces ' '

* Header: Required, 9-19 characters in length, any allowed
* MKE: Required, 2-4 alpha/special characters in length
* Originating Agency Identifier: Required, 9 alphanumeric characters in length

* Weight: Required, 3 characters in length, numeric only in lbs, use leading zero if necessary
* Hair: Required, 3-10 characters in length, alpha only
* Offense: Required, 5-15 characters in length, any allowed
* Date of Warrant/Violation: Required, 8 characters in length, numeric in MMDDYYYY format (allows dates from 1900 to today +1 day, to account for time zone differences)
